					<blockquote class="blockquote">
						<p class="mb-5">
							After the untimely death of 16-year-old Martin's father on the operating table, little by little, a deep and empathetic bond begins to form between him and the respected cardiothoracic surgeon, Dr Steven Murphy. At first, expensive gifts and then an invitation for dinner will soon earn the orphaned teenager the approval of Dr Steven's perfect family, even though right from the start, a vague, yet unnerving feeling overshadows Martin's honest intent. And then, unexpectedly, the idyllic family is smitten by a fierce and pitiless punishment, while at the same time, everything will start falling apart as the innocents have to suffer. In the end, as the sins of one burden the entire family, only an unimaginable and unendurable decision that demands a pure sacrifice can purge the soul. But to find catharsis, one must first admit the sin.
						</p>

							There’s a moment in The Killing of a Sacred Deer in which a teenage boy sinks his teeth into his forearm so deeply, his lips and teeth come up inky with blood. “Do you understand?” he then asks the revolted onlookers. “It’s metaphorical.”

						Secluded from the rest of the world, confined to their affluent home and the high-walled front yard, three siblings, two sisters and one brother, are home-schooled by their parents, having no idea of life outside their prison. Within the family, the patriarch and his submissive wife give their offspring tape-recorded lessons which deliberately teach them the wrong meaning of words, further alienating them from reality. However, when the father introduces the son to Christina, a bad influence and a woman who is hired to service him sexually, the frail equilibrium of things will be disrupted with unforeseen consequences.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-0">Making a movie is making a little society; Gomes makes one that’s open, fluid, integrated, responsive, and forward-looking, whereas Lanthimos makes one that’s closed, dependent, rigid, and nostalgic. That’s why, despite its total lack of engagement with Greece’s current circumstances, “The Lobster” is nonetheless a political film.

					A nurse, a paramedic, a gymnast and her coach have formed a service for hire. They stand in for dead people by appointment, hired by the relatives, friends or colleagues of the deceased. The company is called Alps. The leader, the paramedic, calls himself Mont Blanc. Although Alps members operate under a discipline regime demanded by their leader, the nurse does not.

			<p class="mb-0">On the surface a very simple movie, Dogtooth leaves you questioning much about yourself and the world around us. The film's title brings to mind Eisenhower's resonant phrase when he declared in 1952 that his sleazy vice-presidential running mate must clear himself of the charge of corruption or get off the ticket. "Nixon has got to be as clean as a hound's tooth," he said.

			During off-season at the Greek seaside resort of Kinetta, three perfect strangers--a police officer out of uniform with a thing for German luxury cars and Russian women, an eccentric photographer, and a hotel chambermaid--join forces for a rather strange reason: to recreate homicides. Meticulously and with an almost ritualistic approach, the unlikely trio reenact crime scenes of brutal murders, to the point where the boundaries of their own private lives slowly begin to blur. Does this alliance lead somewhere?

		<p class="mb-0">Is Kinetta a difficult film ? No, not really, just quirky cinema with more content than you think.
